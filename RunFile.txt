Executing the C++ source file:

	1. Given the C++ source code files are in the zip file
	2. now we need to compile it using compiler
	3. we need to use g++ for compiling
	4. The compilation is to be done with "-o" and "-lpthread" for getting executable with desired name.
		g++ CoarseGranedAlgorithm.cpp -lpthread -o <executable>
		g++ FineGrainedAlgorithm.cpp -lpthread -o <executable>
	5. now the compilation is done and the executable file is created with the given name.
	6. now running the executable file
		let exec be the executable file name, then
		./exec gives you all the files containing required data corresponding to the problem
	7. input format is as followed in the pdf
		2 5
		0 1 1 0 0
	        1 0 1 1 0
		1 1 0 1 0
		0 1 1 0 1
		0 0 0 1 0
	8. We can generate input from GenerateGraph.cpp
